## Project Background
As a Power BI specialist and data analyst for Plant Co., a global indoor, outdoor, and landscape plant supplier, I was tasked with developing a high-level Power BI dashboard for the executive team. **This performance report uses 5.1k synthetic sales records from January 2022 to April 2024, covering sales, accounts, and products.** The goal was to transform this data into actionable insights to reflect the company’s performance over the years. This analysis provides strategic insights for decision-making by focusing on key areas such as sales, gross profit, and quantity of sold products. It examines year-to-date (YTD) figures, prior year-to-date (PYTD) data, YTD vs. PYTD, and profit.

## Executive Summary
The analysis provides a snapshot of Plant Co.’s performance across sales, gross profit, and quantity of items sold. Profit percentages remained consistent across all 2,400 sales annually. While sales figures declined in 2023, the quantity of products sold significantly increased. These trends indicate areas for potential year-over-year sales improvements.

## Recommendations
- **Create Private Label Partnerships**
  - Creating private label partnerships moves beyond commodity wholesale and becomes a growth partner for retailers. Instead of supplying the same plants every competitor can offer, collaborating with retailers creates exclusive, co-branded, or white-label plant lines tailored to their target customers.
  - For Plant Co., private label programs generate consistent, predictable demand, strengthen retailer relationships, and elevate the brand from a bulk vendor to a strategic collaborator in retail success.
 
- **Eastablish E-commerce Partnerships**
  - Instead of relying solely on traditional garden centers or physical retailers, partnering with online-first plant shops, major e-commerce platforms, and even lifestyle or home décor taps into the rapidly growing online plant market and aligns with retailers who already have strong digital reach. By serving as the backbone supplier for these digital channels—through dropshipping, white-label fulfillment, or co-branded online collections—the company can expand globally without heavy investment in consumer-facing infrastructure.
  - These partnerships also open the door to data-driven insights, since online retailers can share consumer behavior trends (e.g., popular searches, fast-moving SKUs), enabling Plant Co. to adjust product mix more effectively.
  - This partnership secures new sales channels, improves demand forecasting, and reduces dependence on volatile brick-and-mortar orders, while helping retailers scale their plant offerings quickly with reliable global supply.
 
- **Launch a Digital B2B Portal**
  - A B2B digital portal transforms how retailers interact with Plant Co. and makes it easier for them to do business at scale. By providing a self-service platform, this empowers retailers to browse live inventory, place bulk orders, monitor shipments, and access tailored pricing.
  -  Beyond ordering, the portal can offer value-added tools like demand forecasting dashboards, trend reports by region, marketing collateral downloads, and training resources for retail staff. This can provide innovative features such as AI-driven product recommendations (“best-selling plants in your region”), automated reordering, and subscription-based shipment scheduling.
  -  This digital ecosystem not only streamlines operations but positions Plant Co. as a tech-enabled partner, making it easier for retailers to scale their plant businesses while locking in long-term loyalty and recurring demand.
